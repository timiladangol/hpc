    "### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Can I use MPI for communication between processes on a single node, or is it only for multiple nodes?** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Yes, MPI can be used for communication between processes on a single node as well as across multiple nodes. MPI allows processes to communicate using message passing, which can be done on one node or across multiple nodes, depending on your configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **How do I check the status of my array jobs?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** You can check the status of your array jobs using the squeue command:\n",
    "\n",
    "squeue -u <your_username>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How do I decide how many CPUs to request for my task?**  //DO NOT KNOW THE ANSWER \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What if I don't have enough memory allocated, or what happens if I exceed the allocated memory limit?** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  If the program doesnâ€™t have enough memory, it will likely crash or terminate with an out-of-memory error.\n",
    "If the program exceeds the allocated memory, the system may kill your job to prevent other jobs from being affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **How do I find out how much storage space is available for my job** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** To check available storage space, use the df -h command to check disk usage for available directories.\n"
