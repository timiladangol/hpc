    "### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **How is parallel processing different from sequential processing ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer** : In sequential processing, processes are executed one after another, whereas in parallel processing, multiple processes can run simultaneously. For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "Sequential Processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Download File 1 → Wait for it to finish → Download File 2 → Wait for it to finish → Download File 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel Processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Download File 1, File 2, and File 3 at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **How do HPC systems handle failure or interruptions in processing?** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: High-performance computing systems are designed to keep running even if something goes wrong. One key technique they use is called checkpointing. This means the system periodically saves the current state of a running job. If a failure or interruption occurs, the system can restart from the most recent checkpoint instead of beginning the job from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What is the significance of \"parallel processing\" in HPC?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Parallel processing is a core feature of HPC. It allows a large problem to be divided into many smaller tasks that can be executed at the same time. It drastically reduces the time needed to complete complex computations, making HPC systems ideal for tasks that require high performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **How does HPC handle resource allocation for complex tasks, and how does it ensure optimal efficiency?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: High Performance Computing systems use job schedulers and resource management tools to allocate the right amount of CPU power, memory, and storage for each task. These systems analyze the specific requirements of every job and distribute resources accordingly. They then continuously monitor performance and adjust resource allocation on the fly. This helps balance the workload and prevent bottlenecks. This approach allows complex tasks to run smoothly and optimally.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What are the key differences between running simulations on a local system versus an HPC system for tasks like molecular dynamics or climate modeling?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Local systems typically have limited processing power, memory, and speed. This can slow down simulations and limit the complexity of models they can run. In contrast, HPC systems offer a large number of processors, large memory capacities, and high-speed networks. This allows them to run simulations in parallel, handle larger datasets, and complete complex tasks like molecular dynamics or climate modeling much faster and efficiently.\n",
