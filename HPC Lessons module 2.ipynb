    "### 3. Connecting to the HPC System\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Using SSH (Secure Shell)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Open a terminal on your local machine (Mac/Linux) or a tool like PuTTY (Windows).\n",
    "*   Use the following command to connect:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    ssh username@hellbender-login.rnet.missouri.edu \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "*   Enter your single sign on password when prompted.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Using PuTTY (Windows)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Browse to the [PuTTY download page](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) and download the MSI (‘Windows Installer’) 32-bit or 64-bit version of PuTTY depending on whether you have the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Microsoft Windows.\n",
    "2.  Install PuTTY by running the downloaded installer which should end in a .msi file.\n",
    "3.  Launch PuTTY, and fill in the host name information: `hellbender-login.rnet.missouri.edu` and connect.\n",
    "4.  If this is your first time connecting to the Hellbenders login host, you will be prompted with a message informing you to trust the machine. Press accept.\n",
    "5.  Proceed to login to the machine with your single sign on (SSO) username and password.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Using MobaXTerm (Windows)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Install [MobaXTerm (Home - Installer Edition)](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html), a command line utility used for remotely connecting to machines. This also uses SSH as the backend, however, provides a more user friendly interface.\n",
    "2.  Open the MobaXterm app after installation and you’ll see a list of saved connections which should be empty by default. Additionally, if you have previously installed and used PuTTY, any saved PuTTY sessions will also be listed.\n",
    "3.  You may be prompted to allow access through your machines firewall to access local and private networks through MobaXTerm, proceed by pressing \"Allow\".\n",
    "4.  At the top, press \"Session\", and click \"SSH\". Under the remote host options type in: `hellbender-login.rnet.missouri.edu` and if you know your username you can specify it in the settings as well. Press Okay when finished.\n",
    "5.  Press \"Accept\" when asked to trust the connection.\n",
    "6.  Proceed to login to the machine with your single sign on (SSO) username and password.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Using Command Prompt (Windows)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Press `Windows Key + R` and type in `cmd` and press `Enter`.\n",
    "2.  Type in `ssh username@hellbender-login.rnet.missouri.edu`\n",
    "3.  If this is your first ssh connection to the host, trust it by typing in `yes` and pressing `Enter`.\n",
    "4.  Login with your password.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Using Terminal (Mac/Linux)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Open a terminal on your local machine.\n",
    "2.  Use the following command to connect:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    ssh username@hellbender-login.rnet.missouri.edu \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3.  Trust the connection and enter your single sign on password when prompted.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **SSH Keys (Optional):** For added security, you can set up SSH keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to connect using SSH keys, either to avoid having to type in your password or are wanting to connect from off campus without a VPN, you can add your SSH public key to Hellbender.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generating an SSH Key\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the terminal on your local machine.\n",
    "2. Paste the following command and replace \"sso@example.com\" with your University email address:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"sso@example.com\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, if you're using a legacy system that doesn't support Ed25519, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"sso@example.com\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Press Enter to accept the default file location.\n",
    "4. Type a secure passphrase and enter it again.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding your SSH key\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Copy the contents of your SSH **public** key, which is written to the file created in the previous step.\n",
    "2. Add your public key to your account by appending it to your authorized_keys file on Hellbender:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "vim /home/sso/.ssh/authorized_keys\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also send the key to itrss-support@umsystem.edu and we can add it to your Hellbender account.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Public Key\n",
    "\n",
    "The id_ALGORITHM.pub file contents should look similar to the following examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ed25519:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ssh-ed25519 AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEAklOUpkDHrfHY17SbrmTIpNLTGK9Tjom/BWDSUGP truman@example.com\n",

    "### **Frequently Asked Questions** \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What are SSH keys, and why should I set them up for my HPC account?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** SSH keys are a pair of secure keys (public and private) that help you log into an HPC server. Setting them up allows you to log in without needing to enter your password each time. SSH keys are more secure than passwords because they can't be easily guessed or cracked. This makes the connection to the HPC system safer. SSH keys rely on mathematical operations that make it nearly impossible to reverse engineer the private key from the public key.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What is the difference between public key and private key?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The public key is stored on the server (HPC system) in your user account. It allows the system to recognize your machine and authenticate your connection.\n",
    "The private key stays on your local machine. It is used to prove your identity when you connect to the HPC system. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How do I know if I have the permissions to run specific tasks or access certain files on the system?** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** You can check your permissions by using the ls -l command to inspect file and directory permissions in the HPC system. This command will show you who owns the files and what level of access (read, write, execute) you have. To check if you have permission to run a specific task, try executing the task and look for error messages related to permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Are there any restrictions on the types of software or tools I can use on the HPC system?** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Yes, there may be restrictions on the software you can use. The HPC system usually provides pre-installed software, and installing new tools may require administrative privileges. Some software may also be restricted due to licensing or resource constraints. Always check with system administrators for specific guidelines.\n",
